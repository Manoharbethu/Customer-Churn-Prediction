# 🏦 Customer-Churn-Prediction 
This repository documents the analysis and modeling conducted for the Customer Churn Prediction project in the banking sector. The goal was to develop a robust machine learning model that could accurately predict which customers are likely to discontinue their service, enabling banks to implement proactive retention strategies. <br/>
# 🎯 Key Project Goals and Objectives
Model Development: Build a machine learning model to accurately predict customer churn risk in the banking sector. <br/>
Risk Factor Analysis: Identify crucial factors—including demographics (age, gender), account information (balance, number of products held), credit history, and customer service interactions—that influence churn. <br/>
Strategic Insights: Generate valuable insights for banks to develop targeted and segmented customer retention campaigns. <br/>
Explainability: Investigate the explainability of the models to understand why specific factors drive churn, empowering more effective interventions. <br/>
# 🛠️ Project Methodology and Technologies
The project follows a standard machine learning workflow, including Data Loading, Data Preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Model Training, and Evaluation. <br/>
Data Overview <br/>
Source: A banking customer dataset. <br/>
Size: 10,000 rows and 14 columns. <br/>
Target Variable: Exited (1 = Churned, 0 = Retained). The data is imbalanced, with 7963 customers retained and 2037 customers who exited. <br/>
